# Cuervo's Scripts #
In the last few months I've found myself doing a bunch of repetitive work,
so I plan to add a couple of scripts here gradually to help me automate that.

In my workflow, I normally assume that the machine I'm working on was set up
following my own configuration which can be found here: https://github.com/primercuervo/dotfiles

Please have that into account when running any of the scripts that may appear
in this repository.

# "This script is not working!"
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It works on my machine!

However please feel free to report any problems or suggest improvements!
